 # Summary
 
In the tables shown above, we were able to discover that the majoity to of positions that would need to be filled would be mainly Senior Engineers along with other Senior staff positions. Once the Silver Tsunami begins to take place, the company will need to ramp up their staffing based on the age each person. Hirng for these two postions will need to take precidence so that the company can continue to keep up with buisness needs as the employees start to retire. Amongst those retiring, there are 1549 employees that qualify for the mentorship program. This will be helpful to those not only those that are still within in the company but to those who will become new hires with in in the company.

To see things more clearly bobby will need to create a table to categorize the retirees by age. By doing so he would be able to analyze how the company can go about hiring the replacement staff needed as time goes on. Another table could be used to show how many mentors are needed to help some of the current staff get into higher postions. In conclusion these tables will help the company transitions successfully as fellow employees retire and new one's are ushered in to continue to support the company for future endoevors.
